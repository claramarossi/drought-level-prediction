# drought-level-prediction
Advanced Regression and Classification project

# Course
“Project in Econometrics with R” course - second year of Master Degree. Econometric study, beginning with the specification of the assignment, data collection and/or data preparation, modeling and estimation, and concluding with the documentation of the results. The analyses should be carried out (preferably) using R.

# Project
This project aims to develop a predictive model for drought level using weather data and machine learning techniques. By leveraging features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, the study explores various algorithms—including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost—to identify patterns associated with drought conditions. The dataset used comprises daily weather observations across multiple years and regions. The goal is to determine the most accurate classification model for drought prediction, which can be valuable for early warning systems and agricultural planning. Results indicate that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, provide the highest predictive accuracy.
